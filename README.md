# Winnie-the-Pooh Model Improvement

## Objective
The goal of this project is to enhance the accuracy of a language model in answering questions related to "Winnie-the-Pooh". The model's accuracy will be evaluated using a predefined test set of questions and answers.

## Suggested Next Steps for Improvement

1. **Text Preprocessing:**
    - Experiment with different text preprocessing techniques.
    - Adjust the size of text sections for FAISS indexing. Smaller or larger sections might impact retrieval performance.

2. **Embedding Models:**
    - Test different embedding models from HuggingFace and compare their performance.

3. **Retriever Configuration:**
    - Adjust FAISS index parameters if applicable.
    - Explore different index types or configurations that might improve retrieval accuracy.

4. **Model and Chain Configuration:**
    - Optimize the configuration of your language model and the chain used to generate answers.
    - Ensure that the context length, number of retrieved documents, or any other parameters are set optimally.

5. **Prompt Engineering:**
    - Experiment with different prompt structures and formulations to see how they affect the quality of the generated answers.

6. **Evaluation Metrics:**
    - Change the evaluation metrics in `evaluate_model`, from exact match to embedding-based approaches, to assess the performance of your system comprehensively.

## Documentation
Please remember to document your process and findings in the notebook.

## Good Luck
Good luck, and have fun ðŸ˜¸
