# Winnie the Pooh Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Task

This repository contains the `Winnie_the_Pooh_RAG_task.ipynb` notebook, which demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach using the classic "Winnie the Pooh" text as the base dataset. The notebook illustrates how to combine retrieval and generation techniques to enhance the performance of natural language processing tasks.

## Introduction

The goal of this notebook is to showcase the integration of retrieval mechanisms with generative models. By leveraging the text from "Winnie the Pooh," we aim to enhance the generative capabilities through retrieval-based techniques, providing more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- The following Python libraries:
 - `transformers`
 - `torch`
 - `datasets`
 - `faiss-cpu`

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   
  ```bash
  git clone [https://github.com/KarinBrisker/winnie-the-pooh-rag.git](https://github.com/KarinBrisker/winnie-the-pooh-rag.git)
  cd winnie-the-pooh-rag
  ```

3. **Install the required libraries:**
   ```
   pip install transformers torch datasets faiss-cpu
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

6. **Open the `Winnie_the_Pooh_RAG_task.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.**

## Usage

Follow the steps in the notebook to execute the RAG task. The notebook is structured with explanatory cells and code cells to guide you through the process.

## Notebook Structure

The notebook is organized as follows:

1. **Introduction and Objectives:** Overview of the task and its objectives.
